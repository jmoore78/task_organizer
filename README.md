Full CRUD Flask application using MySQL databse. Allows a user to add a task by name and description which gets displayed on a list page. General form validation but includes conditions to prevent a duplicate entry by name and a duplicate description. Conditional rendering and conditional queries included. I want to envetually add a User class for registration/login with authentication and authorization.
